1. ### What is Hoisting in JavaScript and how to avoid it

   Hoisting in JavaScript is the behavior by which the declaration of variables and functions are moved to the top. This means that    the variable or function declaration need not be done before initializing and calling them.
	
   Hoisting will happen only if ```var``` is used for declaration and not with ```const``` or ```let``` declarations. To avoid hoisting in JavaScript,    the strict mode can be used.

   **Example (Variable Hoisting)**

      Without Hoisting:

      ```javascript
      var num = 4;    // num is declared and then initialized

      console.log(num);    // num is called
      ```

    With Hoisting:

      ```javascript
      num = 4;    // num is declared and then initialized

      console.log(num);    // num is called

      var num // num is declared after initializing it. During execution, this will be moved to the top
      ```
    **Example (Function Hoisting)**

      Without Hoisting:

      ```javascript
      function functionName() {

        console.log("workattech");

    }

    functionName();     // function is called after declaring it
      ```

    With Hoisting:

      ```javascript
      functionName();   // function is called before declaring it

      function functionName() {

        console.log("workattech");

    }
      ```

2. ### What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind

   The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

   **Call:** The call() is a method in JavaScript that helps us to call a function with a given object as the 'this' value. The ```call()``` method takes all the arguments individually.
   
   **Syntax**
   ```javascript
   functionName.call(thisArgument, ...functionArgs);
   ```

   ```javascript
   const personOne = {
  		firstName : "Elon",
  		secondName : "Musk"
	}

	const getFullName = function(company, country) {
 		console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.secondName + ", " + company + ", " + country);
	}

	const personTwo = {
  		firstName : "Mark",
  		secondName : "Zuckerburg"
	}

	getFullName.call(personOne, "Tesla", "United States");    // outputs Elon Musk, Tesla, United States
	getFullName.call(personTwo, "Facebook", "United States");    // outputs Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, United States
   ```
   **Apply:** The apply() method is similar to the call() method. The only difference is that the apply() method takes an array as the argument whereas they were taken individually as arguments in the case of the call() method.

   **Syntax**
    ```javascript
      functionName.apply(thisArgument, functionArgsArray);
    ```

   ```javascript
   const personOne = {
      firstName : "Elon",
      secondName : "Musk"
   }

   const getFullName = function(company, country) {
     console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.secondName + ", " + company + ", " + country);
   }

   const personTwo = {
     firstName : "Mark",
     secondName : "Zuckerburg"
   }

   getFullName.apply(personOne, ["Tesla", "United States"]);    // outputs Elon Musk, Tesla, United States
   getFullName.apply(personTwo, ["Facebook", "United States"]);    // outputs Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, United States
   ```
   In the above example, the company and country parameters were passed as a single array. It was passed individually in the case of the call() method. 

   **bind:** The bind() method is used to create a new function from another function with a given object as the this argument. It creates a copy of the function and then binds it to the object for which it was called. It does not immediately invoke the function and the new copy needs to be invoked separately.

   ```javascript
    const personOne = {
     firstName : "Elon",
     secondName : "Musk"
   }

    const getFullName = function(company, country) {
     console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.secondName + ", " + company + ", " + country);
    }

    const getPersonOneDetails = getFullName.bind(personOne, ["Tesla", "United States"]); 
     getPersonOneDetails();    // outputs Elon Musk, Tesla, United States
   ```
   In the above example, calling the bind method on 'getFullName' creates a copy of it, which is assigned to 'getPersonOneDetails'. When the 'getPersonOneDetails' is called separately, we will get the desired output.

   Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether itâ€™s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.
   

   Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

3. ### What is JSON and its common operations?
	
	**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

   **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object

   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(text);
   ```

   **Stringification:** converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network

   ```javascript
   JSON.stringify(object);
   ```

4. ### What is debouncing?

  	Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance_. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

     Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new timeâ€”300 ms in the future.

     ```js
     function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
       let timer;
       return (...args) => {
         clearTimeout(timer);
         timer = setTimeout(() => {
           func.apply(this, args);
         }, timeout);
       };
     }
     function fetchResults() {
       console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
     }
     const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
     ```

     The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events

     **Input:**

     ```html
     <input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
     ```

     **Button:**

     ```html
     <button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
     ```

     **Windows event:**

     ```html
     window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
     ```
